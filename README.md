# The-ring-election-algorithm

The ring algorithm assumes that the processes are arranged in a logical ring and each process is knows the order of the ring of processes.

Processes are able to “skip” faulty systems: instead of sending to process j, send to j + 1.  

Faulty systems are those that don’t respond in a fixed amount of time.

About Code:
•	Developed distributed ring election algorithm with multi-threaded process which can handle multiple simultaneous elections.

•	Built an idea of logical ring network and how communication works in distributed systems
